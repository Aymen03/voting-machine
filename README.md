An introduction to GUIs with Tkinter

Improvements:

Save results to a CSV file
Calculate winner based on results

Use one voting function and pass parameters to it, instead of multiple functions based on each party

Make sure each user can only vote once

Instead of packing in the buttons, use a grid (look up Tkinter grids)
