An introduction to GUIs with Tkinter

Improvements:

*1* Save results to a (CSV) file

*2* Calculate winner based on results

*3* Use one voting function and pass parameters to it, instead of multiple functions based on each party

*4* Make sure each user can only vote once

*5* Instead of packing in the buttons, use a grid (look up Tkinter grids)

*6* Display some kind of verification / thank you for submitting.
